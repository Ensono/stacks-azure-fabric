=== Service Principal

In order for Terraform to be able to authenticate against Azure and deploy resources, a Service Principal (SP) needs to be created.

==== Fabric Permissions

The Terraform deployment uses the `fabric_capacity` data resource from the Fabric Provider for Terraform. This is used to retrieive the GUID of the Fabric Capacity which is required when creating a Fabric workspace.

In order to allow the SP to access Azure Fabric, the "Service principals can use Fabric APIs" needs to be enabled, this is done in the Fabric Admin Portal.

There are two options to enable the Service Principal to access Fabric APIs:

* **The entire organisation** - This will allow all Service Principals in the org EntraID to access Fabric APIs
* **Specific security groups** - This option allows only the Service Principals that are in the selected security groups to access the Fabric APIs.

NOTE: Creating a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embedded/embed-service-principal?tabs=azure-portal#step-2---create-a-microsoft-entra-security-group[security group] requires access to the Microsoft Graph API.

In addition the Service Principal needs to be able to create workspaces in Fabric.
