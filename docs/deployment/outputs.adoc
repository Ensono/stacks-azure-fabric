=== Outputs

When Terraform runs it generates a number of outputs that can be used in other deployments. There are three output formats that can be generated:

.Terraform output formats
[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Format | Description | Generated
| Terraform | Terraform standard outputs | Yes always
| Env Files | Environment variable files for local development | Optional
| Azure DevOps Variable Grooup | Outputs are saved in variable groups for other pipelines to use | Optional
|===

The outputs that are generated for the environment files and the variable groups are listed in the following table.

.Generated outputs
[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Type
| `analytics_example_lakehouse_id` | ID of the Fabric Lakehouse for the analytics example workload | string
| `analytics_example_workspace_id` | ID of the Fabric Workspace for the analytics example workload | string
| `capacity_admins` | List of the admins of the Fabric Capacity | list(string)
| `engineering_lakehouse_id` | ID of the Fabric Lakehouse for the engineering workload | string
| `engineering_workspace_id` | ID of the Fabric Workspace for the engineering workload | string
| `fabric_capacity_name` | Name of the Fabric Capacity in Azure | string
| `key_vault_name` | Name of the Azure Key Vault for the each environment | string
| `key_vault_resource_id` | Azure Resource ID for the Key Vault | string
| `resource_group_name` | Name of the Azure Resource Group that contains the Fabric resources | string
| `storage_bronze_lakehouse_id` | ID for the Fabric Lakehouse for the storage bronze workload | string
| `storage_bronze_workspace_id` | ID of the Fabric Workspace for the storage bronze workload | string
| `storage_silver_lakehouse_id` | ID of the Fabric Lakehouse for the storage silver workload | string
| `storage_silver_workspace_id` | ID of the Fabric Workspace for the storage silver workload | string
| `storage_goldexample_lakehouse_id` | ID of the Fabric Lakehouse for the storage gold example workload | string
| `storage_goldexample_workspace_id` | ID of the Fabric Workspace for the storage gold example workload | string
|===

NOTE: The outputs from Terraform are always generated, however as they are not consumed directly they are not used in the deployment.

==== Variable Groups

When enabled variable groups are created using the following naming convention:

```
<project>-<environment>-outputs
```

This means the names are predictable and can easily be used in other pipelines.
