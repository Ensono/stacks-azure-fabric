=== Fabric Capacity GUID

When creating a Fabric Workspace, the GUID of the Fabric Capacity is required. This is not exposed by the `azurerm_fabric_capacity` resource as and output.

There is a data resource, called `fabric_capacity`, however an error is generated stating that the SP does not have access to the resource, even though it has been explicitly set on the resource.
