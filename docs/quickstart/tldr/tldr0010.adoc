=== TLDR0010 - Configure the environment variables

Configure a script file to setup the nessecary environment variables. It should be similar to the following.

NOTE: The following example is for a PowerShell environment

[source,powershell]
----
# Azure RM authentication
$env:ARM_CLIENT_ID = ""
$env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = ""
$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = ""
$env:ARM_TENANT_ID = ""

# Fabric provider authentication
# In this case it is using the same Service Principal as the Azure RM provider
$env:FABRIC_TENANT_ID = $env:ARM_TENANT_ID
$env:FABRIC_CLIENT_ID = $env:ARM_CLIENT_ID
$env:FABRIC_CLIENT_SECRET = $env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET

# State where the terraform files are located and the workspace to use
$env:TF_FILE_LOCATION = "deploy/terraform"
$env:ENV_NAME = "dev"

# Arguments that should be passed to Terraform during the init process
$env:TF_BACKEND_INIT = "key=,storage_account_name=stacksstatehjfis,resource_group_name=stacks-terraform-state,container_name=tfstate"

# Configure the envrionments that are required
$env:TF_VAR_environments = "dev:false"
$env:TF_VAR_env_types = "engineering"

# Define a comma seperated list of the permissions that are required
# <upn>:<capacity_admin>:<guid>:<workspace_permission>
$env:TF_VAR_permissions = ""

----

Once the script has been created, run it, e.g. `. ./local/envvars.ps1`.

Please refer to the <<permissions>> section for the correct pattern to use for the permissions variable.
