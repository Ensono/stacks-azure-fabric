=== Deployment

The deployment of the infrastructure consists of three stages:

1. Initialise terraform so that all of the modules and providers are downloaded and ready to use
2. Plan the deployment. This creates a plan of work that will be done by Terraform.
3. Apply the plan. This task uses the plan that has been generated and applies it to the Azure environment.

As usual all of the commands are run using the `eirctl` command.

[source,powershell,linenums]
----
# Initialise Terraform
eirctl infra:init

# Plan the deployment
eirctl infra:plan

# Apply the deployment
eirctl infra:apply
----

The following shows example outputs for the three stages of the deployment

After the deployment has been applied, the resource group will contain the Azure Fabric capacity and an Azure Key Vault, which is based on the Azure resource type, company name, project, location and environment.
