=== Clone repository

In order to deploy the infrastructure for Azure Fabric, the repository containing the Terraform files needs to be cloned to the local workstation.

[source,bash]
----
# Create working directory
mkdir ~/working
cd ~/working

# Clone the respository
git clone https://github.com/ensono/stacks-azure-fabric.git

[IMPORTANT]
.Working from a branch
====
Sometimes new updates mean that things have to be tested from a branch rather than the trunk. To do this, the branch has to be fetched from the remote and and then checked out.

[source,bash]
----
# Fetch the branch
git fetch origin feat/docs-update

# Switch to the branch
got checkout feat/docs-update
