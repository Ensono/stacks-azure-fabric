[#get_id_of_ad_user]
=== Find ID of EntraID User

In order to be able to administer a Fabric capacity, the IDs of the users need to be provided. Currently this is done by passing in a comma separated list of the users IDs.

It would be more efficient to be able to pass in the email of the user and the have Terraform find the ID of the user in the EntraID Directory.

The https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs[Azure AD Provider] from Hashicorp would need to be added to the Terraform deployment.

Additionally the service principal that is used would have to have read permissions in the directory to be able to find the user ID.
